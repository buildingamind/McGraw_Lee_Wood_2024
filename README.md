# Walkthough
This repository contins the materials and source code associated with `Parallel development of social behavior in biological and artificial fish. (McGraw, Lee, Wood 2024)`  Nature Communications.


## Raw Data is presented in 3 locations of this repository:

### 1. Figures Excel File
All Raw data associated with each figure is included under `/All Data/McGraw, Lee, Wood 2024 - Nature Communications - Final Figures Data Source.xlsx`

### 2. Raw CSV files are available in `/All Data`
The remaining files are the raw .csv file versions of the data generated from the scripts (Present also in each of the experiment directories described below)

### 3. Raw CSV files, Significance Tests, and Figures are also grouped by experiment, task, and condition

The raw data is also included according to the experiment based on Experiment 2 or 3, followed by the task, condition, and model type, (e.g. `Experiment 3 - Us vs Them in Two Colored Fishes/EXP3_2AFC_TASK/EXP3_2FAC_FULL_CSV/FULL_CUR_2AFC_SocialPreference_by_Episode.csv`)
